  "description": " it is a single row angular contact bearing. These bearings have solid inner- and outer rings. They owe their name to the contact angle that is created as the raceways of the inner and outer rings are offset from each other along the bearing axis. The bearing rings have one high and one low shoulder. Thanks to the low shoulder, a large number of balls can be incorporated in the bearing. Single row angular contact bearings can support high radial forces and axial forces in one direction. The greater the contact angle, the greater the axial load capacity of the bearing.",

  "description": "The SL18-2924B INA is a single-row, full-complement cylinder bearing. This bearing type has a solid outer and inner ring and a high number of cylindrical rollers. These rollers are guided between the ribs of the rings. Since there is no cage, the maximum number of rolls can be used. As a result, these bearings can support very high radial loads. However, the maximum speed is lower than the speed of cylindrical roller bearings with cages. Single-row full-complement cylindrical roller bearings can also support axial forces in one direction. They are used as support bearings. Support bearings allow axial displacement of the shaft relative to the housing in one direction. The shaft is located axially in the other direction.",

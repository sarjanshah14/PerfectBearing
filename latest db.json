    "description": "The SL1829/530-B INA is a single-row, full-complement cylinder bearing. This bearing type has a solid outer and inner ring and a high number of cylindrical rollers. These rollers are guided between the ribs of the rings. Since there is no cage, the maximum number of rolls can be used. As a result, these bearings can support very high radial loads. However, the maximum speed is lower than the speed of cylindrical roller bearings with cages. Single-row full-complement cylindrical roller bearings can also support axial forces in one direction. They are used as support bearings. Support bearings allow axial displacement of the shaft relative to the housing in one direction. The shaft is located axially in the other direction.",
